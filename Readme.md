# input3.json
- is not adjusted for lab sections
# input.json
- lab section adjusted
# To-do
- now need to tie main section to the lab section and
load them into a dictionary
- key: lab section id, value: main section id
- also sort it, make non-lab sections goes first
- add a method in the Schedule class to do that (as a hard constraint)
- add a method in Criteria to check lab sections
- problem: probably a specific method to do the crossover for lab sections
